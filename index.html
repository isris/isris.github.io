				<h2>Srishti Singh</h2>
				<h3> <i>Jack of all trades, master of some</i> </h3>
				<p> Hi! I am a software engineer from India. <br> 
					My recent work experience was at an early stage startup doing a cross-functional development role working on social-media data mining and analysis (sentiment analysis, intent analysis, entity recognition, etc.), with a focus on providing data-driven metrics to online content creators and analysing user-growth patterns on video streaming platforms like Youtube, building features and functionalities backed by data science/machine learning.
					Starting 2018 and until 2020 I had my one foot in general software development and one in machine learning. Starting 2021, I have finally decided to curb my curiosity of the former field and pursue machine learning more sincerely.  <br>
					<br>*This portfolio website is a work in progress so most of the links mentioned below are broken. I'll update them soon.
